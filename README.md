FixIt

App that allows you to instantly report maintenance issues around university campus (or office, public space, ..). Normally, these issues are not urgent enough to have bypassers make the effort to report them to the appropriate authorities - FixIt streamlines the process. Janitors and staff are thus better informed of things that need fixing.

The app is progressive and mobile-friendly, enabling you to snap an image of a maintenance issue, such as a non-functioning PC, broken door handle, or a pothole in the pavement, and immediately upload it to the database of issues. Other users will be able to vote on issues that are already posted.

Each university students logs in with their name and student ID in order to prevent trolling and other non-serious uses of the application.

The app was built using Django, AWS, HTML & CSS. The app without CSS functionality is also deployed online on TeamCC-tests.elasticbeanstalk.com.
